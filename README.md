# BSModalDZ
Simple integration example of Bootstrap Modal & Dronzone.js.
Open modal, click and drop file(s), and see it uploaded (upon success) in your Django project's media file.

### Installation
Please make sure you have Django installed as well have access to jQuery and Bootstrap.

### Usage
Currently, the project shows successful integration between Dropzone.JS inside a Boostrap Modal with transfer of files in a Django backend. Any and all code can be used for your own purpose :) Additional functionalities will be added in future; check Backlog for more information.

### Backlog
- Additional form and form information transfer
- Progress bar and success/error messages
- Taking requests :)
